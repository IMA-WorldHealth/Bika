# FAQ


### What is Bika?

Bika aims to provide a FOSS Health Information Managment System (HIMS) for rural hospitals.  This entails a full-fledged accounting system, patient registration, tracking and billing, reporting, and operations management.  Bika is being actively developed in javascript, using a [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org "Nodejs.org") server and the [Dojo Toolkit](http://www.dojotoolkit.org "www.dojotoolkit.org") for UI.

### Why is Bika necessary?

Bika grew out of an effort to port [care2x](http://www.care2x.org "www.care2x.org") to use French as the principal language and Congolese Francs as the principal currency.  After a year of research, the project was abandoned in favor of a blank sheet rewrite with a local team of developers.  The benefits of an information system in the reference hospitals of Congo's health zones are beyond the scope of this README.

### When will Bika be released?

The code is free to grab anytime!  Beta builds are slated for summer of 2014, though alpha builds should be appearing by Febuary 2014.

### How can I contribute?

Excellent question!  Pull request are always welcome, provided they provide appropriate tests and documentation.  We currently use Jasmine as our testing platform, and documentation is welcome in Markdown.  Because Bika is being developed specifically for rural hosptials in the D.R. Congo, the priorities are very different from most other Open Source projects.  Feel free to drop a line to <IMAEsque@imaworldhealth.org> if you want to know more about the project and how you can help us meet our goals.

### What's with all the French commits and comments?

Our planning and development is primarily in French.  We hope to provide translations for virtually everything we do, but have not done so sufficiently yet.  Do not let that hinder you from pitching in!

### Who supports Bika's development?

Our team is greatful to be completely sponsored by [IMA World Health](http://www.imaworldhealth.org "www.imaworldhealth.org").  IMA has many years of experience working in the D.R. Congo towards improving public and rural health.
